Hi I'm designing a web app to help track my backpacking rehab process.

Problem/Solution:
1. Don't understand authentication explanation in strava docs.
    a. Found simple medium article to help
    https://medium.com/swlh/using-python-to-connect-to-stravas-api-and-analyse-your-activities-dummies-guide-5f49727aac86
2. Listing all activities doesn't include the description. My plan was to parse the description for the weight and potentially other factors.
    a. Could list weight in title.
    b. Could specifically call all 'hike' activities using their id to get descriptions.
